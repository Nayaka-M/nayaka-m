. How data was recorded
30 participants (referred as subjects in this dataset) performed activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone. The phone was configured to record two implemented sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). For these time series the directors of the underlying study performed feature generation and generated the dataset by moving a fixed-width window of 2.56s over the series. Since the windows had 50% overlap the resulting points are equally spaced (1.28s).This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

By using the sensors(Gyroscope and accelerometer) in a smartphone, they have captured '3-axial linear acceleration'(tAcc-XYZ) from accelerometer and '3-axial angular velocity' (tGyro-XYZ) from Gyroscope with several variations.

prefix 't' in those metrics denotes time.

suffix 'XYZ' represents 3-axial signals in X , Y, and Z directions.
. How is the Data preprocessed?
After getting Raw Sensor Data the Expert (Domain Expert, Signal Engineer Expert) are preprocessed this data and make some useful feature. I am not expert but what I understand I explain here how these data are preprocessed.

These sensor signals are preprocessed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width windows (sliding windows) of 2.56 seconds each with 50% overlap. ie., each window has 128 readings.


Human Data Recognition
Human data recognition refers to the ability of machines to recognize and interpret human-related data, such as:

Types of Human Data
