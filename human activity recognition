We have a fairly small data set of Human Activity Recognition that has been labeled as “Walking”, “Walking Upstairs”, “Walking Downstairs”, “Standing”, “Sitting” and “Lying”. We had downloaded HAR Dataset from UCI dataset storehouse and we know that the data set is define in two part first is RAW data set and second is pre-engineered by domain or signal expert engineer. So first, we use pre-engineered dataset with classical machine learning (ML) to learn from the data, and predict the human Activity. Second, we could then use RAW dataset with Deep learning model to learn from the data, and predict the human Activity.

Which type of ML Problem is this?
Human activity recognition, is a challenging time series classification task. It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model.

OR in other words you can call, it is a multiclass classification problem, for given a new datapoint we have to predict the Human Activity. And Each datapoint corresponds one of the 6 Activities.

What is the best performance metric for this Problem?
Accuracy : For any model we have printed the over all accuracy with this simple “Accuracy” metric.

Confusion Matrix : The very important thing that the confusion Matrix had told us what type of errors and what types of confusion are happening.

Simply for understanding this metric for this project view, we know that we have 6 class label and often times it could so happen that our Model will be confused between sitting or standing, and walking upstairs or walking downstairs.
